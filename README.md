# Admin Repository

Holds workflows triggering [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [Safe-Settings](https://github.com/github/safe-settings) across all my repositories, as well as configuration files for Safe-Settings specifying global and per-repository settings (e.g. label colors, etc.)

**NOTE:** The Renovate workflow is now disabled, as it's run self-hosted via Renovate Operator.
